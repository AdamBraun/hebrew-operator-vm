# ש — שין (tilted ן spine + two ו attached at the terminal end)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

* **Select:** current focus (F).
* **Bound:** produce a structured handle with three internal access points:

  * (F^{\text{spine}}): sealed baseline/continuation spine (the ן)
  * (F^{L}, F^{R}): two exported access-handles (the two ו)
    All three inherit the currently-effective constraint bundle of (F).
* **Seal:** replace focus by this structured object, with a deterministic default active branch.
* **שׁ vs שׂ:** when `inside_dot_kind=shin_dot_right`, activate (F^{R}); when `inside_dot_kind=shin_dot_left`, activate (F^{L}); the other handle remains latent/available.
* **Key difference:** ש creates multiple internal handles inside one construction, not parallel futures.
