# צ — צדי (non-final)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

* **Select:** current focus (F) and an exemplar (x^*\in F) (the pinned reference).
* **Bound:** enforce the exemplar’s effective bundle across all of (F); normalize the focus to one standard.
* **Seal:** commit the aligned state as the new baseline (cascade-compatible: later narrower selections may override locally).
* **Key difference:** צ is continuation under guidance of a pinned reference, not outward tethering.

## Signature
