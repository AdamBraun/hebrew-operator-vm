# מ — MEM-open (open from-zone as pending obligation)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

- **Select:** current anchor/focus handle (x) and active “from/within” relation (\in_C).
- **Bound:** allocate a fresh zone handle (Z := MemZone(x)) representing (M(x):={y | y \in_C x}) as a soft membrane (refinable/nestable).
- **Seal:** push obligation:

  ```text
  push OStack_word := {
    kind=MEM_ZONE, parent=F, child=Z, payload={anchor:x}, tau_created=τ
  }
  ```

  Keep (F) unchanged (mem-open does not enter the zone).

## Signature

- Arity: req 1, opt 0.
- Operand kinds: any.
- Selection precedence: default (see `spec/60-VM.md`).
- Distinctness/reflexive: default (see `registry/letters.yaml`).

## Tests
