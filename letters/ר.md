# ר — Corner / head-handle (unanchored; paired with ד)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

* **Select:** an inside `ScopeHandle` (F) and an outside scope (from R or boundary context).
* **Bound:** construct an unanchored head boundary `Head_unanchored(F, outside)` producing `BoundaryHandle(a=0)`.
* **Seal:** allocate the boundary handle, attach a head pin (י-like) and three deterministic ports (ש-like: inside/surface/outside), and register it as a stable head for later selection.
* **Note (milui):** רי״ש (ראש) reads as head + pin + tri-port interface; the midrashic split (ראש/רע) matches the unanchored head (a=0).

## Signature
