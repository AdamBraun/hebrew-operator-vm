# פ — Mouth-open articulation (פה פתוח)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

* **Select:** a speaker/source handle (x), an internal payload (q) representable as an interior scope (q\subseteq \operatorname{Int}(x)), and optionally an audience/target scope (T) (default: current ambient scope).
* **Bound:** form an utterance-object (u) that exports interior structure as an external bound; inject into (\Phi) a rule ((T,\text{bound}=u(q),\text{priority})).
* **Seal:** log (\text{utter}(x,q,T)) in (H) and reify the utterance as a handle; keep the mouth-channel open for further refinement/append.
* **Note:** the shape reads as a mouth boundary enclosing an interior ב; the sense is “export inside to outside.”
