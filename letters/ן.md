# ן — Support Open+Close (implemented)

Status: implemented in reference interpreter.

## Signature

- Arity: req 1, opt 0.
- Operand kinds: any.
- Selection precedence: default (see `spec/60-VM.md`).
- Distinctness/reflexive: default (see `registry/letters.yaml`).

## Select

Selects the current focus handle `F`.

## Bound

Allocates a successor scope `F⁺`, records a continuation `cont(F, F⁺)`.

## Seal

Opens a `SUPPORT` obligation and immediately discharges it. The resulting handle is marked `policy=framed_lock`.

## Obligations

- Opens: `SUPPORT`
- Closes: `SUPPORT`

## Macro form

- Uses `V` to extend continuation and `Y` to seed the successor, then seals with immediate discharge.

## Tests

- `/tests/letters/README.md#final-nun`
