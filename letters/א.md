# א — Identification / alias with transport

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

* **Select:** pick two handles (h1,h2) intended to denote the same referent (possibly across two representations/views).
* **Bound:** assert (h1 \equiv h2) and register bidirectional transport maps T(h1\to h2), T(h2\to h1) that propagate constraints deterministically; resolve collisions via the existing cascade rule (priority/scope/recency).
* **Seal:** commit a single alias-handle a := Alias(h1,h2) so future addressing of h1 or h2 resolves to a (using transport when needed).

## Signature
