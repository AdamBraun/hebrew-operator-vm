# ס — Support-ring / stabilization hull

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

* **Select:** current handle (X), its active bounds, and its boundary surface (\partial X).
* **Bound:** impose a support hull (\mathrm{Hull}(X)) that forbids boundary-crossing drift by default and treats the structure as load-bearing; later operators may act inside (X) but cannot perturb the frame without explicit boundary rewrite.
* **Seal:** commit X^{\mathrm{stable}} and set `policy := framed_lock` so the cascade respects the hull.
  * **Discharge hook:** if `top(OStack_word)` is a SUPPORT obligation with (o.child <=cont* F), pop it and optionally log `support(o.child, F, τ)`. Under strict nesting, any other top kind is ill-formed for a support discharge.
* **Note:** סמך is “closed and not open” (wall-like enclosure) and “supports the low,” matching a bounded-but-self-holding frame.
