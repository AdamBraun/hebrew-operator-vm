# כ — Capacity-cast as portioning (kaf = כף)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

* **Select:** target (x) and template (T) (implicit if absent).
* **Bound:** compute a capacity-limited portion and residue:

  * p := portion_T(x) (largest/canonical subpart of x that fits T)
  * r := x \ p
* **Seal:** commit p as a unitized handle (`unitized=1`), set focus to it, and return (r\_out := r).
  * **Final ך:** same, but additionally closes the relevant aspect to further refinement (policy gating).
* **Note:** “as/like” is the special case where T is another object/pattern (“x-as-Y”); “capacity/measure” is the case where T is a vessel/limit.
