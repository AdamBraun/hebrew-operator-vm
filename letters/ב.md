# ב — Boundary-Open (implemented)

Status: implemented in reference interpreter.

## Signature

- Arity: req 1, opt 0.
- Operand kinds: any.
- Selection precedence: default (see `spec/60-VM.md`).
- Distinctness/reflexive: default (see `registry/letters.yaml`).

## Select

Selects the current focus handle `F`.

## Bound

Allocates a new child scope handle `child` inside `parent = F` and records a continuation from `parent` to `child`.

## Seal

Pushes a `BOUNDARY` obligation onto `OStack_word` with `(parent, child, anchor=1)` and returns `child` as `h_out`. Residue is `⊥`.

## Obligations

- Opens: `BOUNDARY`

## Macro form

- Uses `Y` to seed the child scope and `V` to establish continuation; placement `Δ_ב` defers boundary closure to a later seal.

## Tests

- `/tests/letters/README.md#bet`
