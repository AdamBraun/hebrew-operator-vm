# ב — Containment / “inside”

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

* **Select:** an anchor (x) and an active containment relation (\operatorname{in}_C) (what counts as “inside Dan” depends on context (C)).
* **Bound:** shift the *reference frame* to the interior of (x):
  [
  B(x):;;\text{Context} := \operatorname{Int}_C(x)
  ]
  Meaning: subsequent names resolve **relative to (x)**.
* **Seal:** commit the scoping boundary “inside (x)” as the current ambient world until changed.
