# י — Seed / pin / handle-initiation (Y primitive)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

- **Select:** an anchor (x) (a person/object already in focus).
- **Bound:** create the minimal _addressable seed_ on/for (x):
  [
  \iota(x);;=;;\text{“the pinned handle of }x\text{”}
  ]
  This is not a class, not an interior, not a target—just the minimal “this-exact-one” hook that other relations can attach to.
- **Seal:** commit (\iota(x)) as stable under further refinement: subsequent letters may change what you look at _relative to_ (x), but the hook stays (x).
  - **Interface lead (ו):** the pin includes a single exported attachment port so later letters can bind to it after focus shifts.
  - **Anchored interface (ד):** set anchor bit (a=1) by default; treat the pin as a micro door between anchored inside and ambient outside.
- **Note (latest):** this (Y) is the universal prefix used implicitly by all letters in (f*\ell=\Delta*\ell\circ V\circ Y). “Extra yuds” that distinguish letters (e.g., the yud-behind of ד vs ר) are not this base-seed; they live in (\Delta\_\ell) as **anchoring** or other structural modifiers.

## Signature

- Selection precedence: default (see `spec/60-VM.md`).
- Distinctness/reflexive: default (see `registry/letters.yaml`).
