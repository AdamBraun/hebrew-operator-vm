# ז — Gate / armed channel (ו with bilateral head)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

* **Select:** an existing relation involving the current focus (membership, pairing, continuation-link, flow).
* **Bound:** insert a guarded mediator on that relation (x \to y becomes x \to g \to y) and attach a policy bundle to g (throttle/allow/deny); “cut” is the forced-closed special case.
* **Seal:** reify g as a stable handle so later letters can refine the gate locally (cascade-compatible).
* **Note:** midrash frames ז’s tagin as oriented toward ו and ח, aligning the operator to the gate between open channel and closed boundary; זין = gate → pin → persist.
