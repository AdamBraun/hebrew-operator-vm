# ל — Endpoint interface (to/for, keyed-by)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

- **Select:** endpoint (x) and an active “to/at” relation (\to_C), plus an optional source scope (s) from (F/R/\Omega).
- **Bound:** open a candidate membrane (M_s) as the domain of eligible (y), form the endpoint fiber (L_s(x)={y\in M_s\mid y\to_C x}), and cut an anchored door boundary that treats L_s(x) as the admitted-at-(x) interface.
- **Seal:** commit an `EndpointHandle(x, domain=M_s, fiber=L_s(x), door=D_x)` and set focus to it.
- **Note (milui):** למד reads as endpoint (ל) + domain membrane (מ) + anchored door (ד).
