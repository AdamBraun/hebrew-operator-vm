# ק — Indistinguishability (≈) + optional descent-to-action channel

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

* **Select:** two targets (x,y).
* **Bound:** assert (x\approx y) (treat as interchangeable for selection/rules, without identity merge).
  * **Optional (latest, qof-mode):** attach a “projection-to-action” channel (\pi_\downarrow) (a descender) allowing the ≈-equivalence to be *realized in execution* (think: similarity that can descend into concrete deeds/outputs).
  * **Optional (definition):** (\pi_\downarrow := \text{V-channel} \circ \text{closed-mouth seal}) so descent is a vav-transport followed by a final ף-style freeze.
* **Seal:** store (\approx)-class (and if present (\pi_\downarrow)) so later selectors may pick “any representative” unless forced to distinguish; execution may use (\pi_\downarrow) when the context enables descent. Descended artifacts are sealed as `policy=final` while (\approx) remains soft.
* **Note (milui):** קו״ף reads as ≈ plus a vav-channel and a final ף freeze; the name is the descender.
