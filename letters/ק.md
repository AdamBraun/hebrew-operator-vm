# ק — Indistinguishability (≈) + optional descent-to-action channel

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

- **Select:** two targets (x,y).
- **Bound:** assert (x\approx y) (treat as interchangeable for selection/rules, without identity merge).
  - **Optional (latest, qof-mode):** attach a “projection-to-action” channel (\pi\_\downarrow) (a descender) allowing the ≈-equivalence to be _realized in execution_ (think: similarity that can descend into concrete deeds/outputs).
  - **Optional (definition):** (\pi\_\downarrow := \text{V-channel} \circ \text{closed-mouth seal}) so descent is a vav-transport followed by a final ף-style freeze.
- **Seal:** store (\approx)-class (and if present (\pi*\downarrow)) so later selectors may pick “any representative” unless forced to distinguish; execution may use (\pi*\downarrow) when the context enables descent. Descended artifacts are sealed as `policy=final` while (\approx) remains soft.
- **Note (milui):** קו״ף reads as ≈ plus a vav-channel and a final ף freeze; the name is the descender.

## Signature

- Arity: req 1, opt 0.
- Operand kinds: any.
- Selection precedence: default (see `spec/60-VM.md`).
- Distinctness/reflexive: default (see `registry/letters.yaml`).
