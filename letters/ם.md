# ם — Mem Close (implemented)

Status: implemented in reference interpreter.

## Signature

- Arity: req 1, opt 0.
- Operand kinds: any.
- Selection precedence: default (see `spec/60-VM.md`).
- Distinctness/reflexive: default (see `registry/letters.yaml`).

## Select

Selects the current focus handle `F`.

## Bound

No special bound behavior; the construction base is `F`.

## Seal

If a `MEM_ZONE` obligation is on top of `OStack_word`, it is popped and closed. A mem-handle is exported. If no `MEM_ZONE` is pending, `ם` opens and closes a new zone immediately and exports it.

## Obligations

- Closes: `MEM_ZONE`

## Macro form

- Uses `Y` to finalize the pending zone into an exported handle.

## Tests

- `/tests/letters/README.md#final-mem`
