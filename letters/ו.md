# ו — Extension / channel + Connect (V primitive) (your classroom split)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

- **Select:** two targets/sets (A,B) (often “the class” and a criterion/handle), plus an optional mode `V(mode)` where `mode ∈ {plain, seeded, transport}`.
- **Bound (internal act):** create a grouping/connection structure (bind/extend):
  - if (A) contains multiple students, induce a partition (A \to {g_1,\dots,g_k})
  - add links “member-of” from students to groups, and a link that ties all groups under one classroom-configuration

- **Seal:** **reify the groups as first-class objects** and switch level (\lambda:=\text{group}). After sealing, later letters can target groups as units (CSS-like specificity narrowing).
- **External residue (explicit):** any binding/partition induces an outside remainder (who is not in the induced structure); represent via (B) and (R).
- **Mode semantics:**
  - `plain` (וו): pure extension with no interior pivot.
  - `seeded` (ויו): extension through a pinned port (Y inside V).
  - `transport` (ואו): extension mediated by alias/transport (א inside V).

- **Note (latest):** this letter’s semantics also serves as the universal (V) prefix used implicitly by all letters in (f*\ell=\Delta*\ell\circ V^{v(\ell)}\circ Y^{y(\ell)}). The distinct “letter ו” is (V) plus its own (\Delta\_\text{ו}); milui selects the mode.
