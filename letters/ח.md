# ח — Enclosure / compartment (domain with a controlled interface)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

- **Select:** a candidate interior handle (X) and its boundary-crossing relations (E\_{\partial}(X)).
- **Bound:** construct a compartment (H(X)) and rewrite each crossing edge through a boundary gate (u \to v becomes u \to g_e \to v) with a default-closed policy; internal flow continues (left ו), external access is mediated (right ז).
- **Seal:** reify (H(X)) as a selectable scope and register its interface gates as addressable handles for later cascade refinement.
- **Note:** ח is formed from ו + ז bridged by a roof; חית suggests enclosure → pin → finalize.

## Signature

- Arity: req 1, opt 0.
- Operand kinds: any.
- Selection precedence: default (see `spec/60-VM.md`).
- Distinctness/reflexive: default (see `registry/letters.yaml`).
