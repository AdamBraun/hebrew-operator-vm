# ד — Boundary / door (anchored corner)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

* **Select:** an inside `ScopeHandle` (F) and an outside scope (from R or boundary context).
* **Bound:** construct an anchored head boundary `Head_anchored(F, outside)` producing `BoundaryHandle(a=1)`.
* **Seal:** allocate the boundary handle, attach an anchored head pin and three deterministic ports (inside/surface/outside), and register it as a stable scope boundary for later selection.

## Signature

- Arity: req 1, opt 0.
- Operand kinds: any.
- Selection precedence: default (see `spec/60-VM.md`).
- Distinctness/reflexive: default (see `registry/letters.yaml`).

## Tests

- `/tests/letters/README.md#dalet`
