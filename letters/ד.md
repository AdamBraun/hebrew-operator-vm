# ד — Boundary-Close (implemented)

Status: implemented in reference interpreter.

## Signature

- Arity: req 1, opt 0.
- Operand kinds: any.
- Selection precedence: default (see `spec/60-VM.md`).
- Distinctness/reflexive: default (see `registry/letters.yaml`).

## Select

Selects the current focus handle `F`.

## Bound

No special bound behavior; uses the current focus as construction base.

## Seal

If the top `OStack_word` obligation is `BOUNDARY`, it is popped and closed. Otherwise, a new child scope is created inside `F` and then closed immediately. The seal allocates a boundary handle with `anchor=1` and records a boundary relation between inside and outside.

## Obligations

- Closes: `BOUNDARY` (or opens+closes when none is pending).

## Macro form

- Uses `Y` to seed a boundary interface and `V` to connect inside/outside ports; placement `Δ_ד` commits the boundary.

## Tests

- `/tests/letters/README.md#dalet`
