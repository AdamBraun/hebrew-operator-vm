# ג — Directed bestowal (flow landing on a point)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

- **Select:** source (x), recipient (y), and payload (p) with (p\in M(x)).
- **Bound:** add a directed bestowal (x \xrightarrow{\text{bestow }p} y) and re-key the payload as endpointed to the recipient (p \to \iota(y)) (the internal ל stage).
- **Seal:** log (\text{bestow}(x,p,y)) at (\tau), reify the transfer as a selectable handle, and shift focus toward the recipient (or union with it).
- **Internal factorization (milui):** ג = sealed pipeline of **י–מ–ל**: pin recipient (\iota(y)), extract payload from source (p\in M(x)), bind payload to recipient (p\in L(\iota(y))).
- **Note:** the shape reads as ו + י (flow terminating in a point), matching the directed landing semantics.
- **Optional (privacy):** the event may seal into a non-public layer when a discreet transfer is intended.
