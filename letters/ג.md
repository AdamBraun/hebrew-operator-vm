# ג — Directed Link (implemented)

Status: implemented in reference interpreter.

## Signature

- Arity: req 2, opt 0.
- Operand kinds: any.
- Selection precedence: default (see `spec/60-VM.md`).
- Distinctness/reflexive: default (see `registry/letters.yaml`).

## Select

Selects two operands `(from, to)` using the default selection order.

## Bound

Creates a construction linking `from → to`.

## Seal

Allocates a structured link handle labeled `gimel` and records a link `from → to` with label `gimel`.

## Obligations

None.

## Macro form

- Uses `V` as the primary connector; placement `Δ_ג` binds the link into a selectable handle.

## Tests

- `/tests/letters/README.md#gimel`
