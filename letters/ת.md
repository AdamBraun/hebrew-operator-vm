# ת — Hard-finalization + outward mark (תי״ו)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

* **Select:** current active construction (F), its effective bundle (\psi=\mathrm{eff}(F,\Phi)), and its boundary context (B).
* **Bound:** close the scope with a terminal boundary (B_{\text{end}}(F)), freeze interior bounds from further refinement, and emit an outward mark (m(F)) on the external face of B_{\text{end}}(F).
* **Seal:** reify the completed artifact (A=(F,\psi,B_{\text{end}}(F),m(F))) in a completed registry, set `policy := final`, log (\mathrm{finalize}(A)) at (\tau), and shift focus to the outside residue.
* **Note:** ת encodes “finish-and-stamp”: dalet closure plus outward vav mark, pinned as an addressable handle.
