# ט — Covert internalization with a single exported handle

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

* **Select:** current target handle (X) and an intended internal patch/action (\pi).
* **Bound:** apply (\pi) to the interior of (X) and mark it latent/hidden; create a single exported proxy/port (p=\mathrm{port}(X,\pi)) as the only outward handle.
* **Seal:** commit the hidden interior patch in a non-default layer and reify (p) as the only externally reachable handle to the hidden good.

## Signature

- Arity: req 1, opt 0.
- Operand kinds: any.
- Selection precedence: default (see `spec/60-VM.md`).
- Distinctness/reflexive: default (see `registry/letters.yaml`).

## Tests

- None (stub).
