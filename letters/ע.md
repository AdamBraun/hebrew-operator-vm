# ע — עין (נ + ו at base)

Status: spec synced with `mission-statement.md`. Implementation may differ.

## Definition (from mission-statement)

* **Select:** pick a target (x) from current focus (F).
* **Bound:** create a persistent watch-handle on (x): a live tether (ו) that keeps “this target” selectable across later scope/focus shifts (the persistence aspect comes from the נ-thread).
* **Seal:** reify the watch-handle as an addressable selector (the recorded eye); it stays available even when (F) changes.
* **Key difference:** ע creates one persistent pointer, not multiple branches.

## Signature
